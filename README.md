# discord-icons

This repository contains .png files of the icons for every branch of the Discord client. It also includes some cool
Discord hard drive icons that can be found in the mac .dmg files.

Mac icons were extracted from the .app files for each branch. Windows/Linux icons were extracted from the .tar.gz files
for each branch. Hard Drive icons were extracted from the .dmg files for each branch. If they were not already a .png,
they have been converted to that.

You can also see all of them here:
